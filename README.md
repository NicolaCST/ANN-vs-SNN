# ANN-vs-SNN
## Comparison of performances and power consumption between ANNs and SNNs
From 2012 to 2021 the amount of computational
power required to run state-of-the-art deep learning
models has increased at a rate of 10x per year.
The use of an ever increasing models size not only
poses significant challenges in terms of computational
resources and energy consumption, but it also
raises concerns about its environmental sustainability.


A promising solution to these concernings are the
Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs): biologically plausible
nets that are notoriously energy-efficient due
to the binary spike signals that convert traditional
high-power multiply-accumulation (MAC) into a lowpower
accumulation (AC). In this project we will analyze
the differences in terms of performances and
energy consumption among classical ANNs and the
modern SNNs on several benchmark data sets
